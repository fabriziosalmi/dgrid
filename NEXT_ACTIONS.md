**Objective:** Verify entire system works end-to-end before public launch.

**Action Items:**

```
1. [ ] Run QUICK_START_TEST.md
   Location: /Users/fab/GitHub/dgrid/QUICK_START_TEST.md
   Time: ~10 minutes
   Expected: All 7 checkpoints pass ✅
   
2. [ ] Verify dashboard generation
   Check: index.html created with correct stats
   Check: Node status shows correctly
   Check: Task counts are accurate
   
3. [ ] Verify auto-healing
   Check: Orphaned task moved back to queue/
   Check: git commit+push successful
   Check: Dashboard cleanup logged correctly
   
4. [ ] Run full TEST_LOCALE.md cycle
   Location: /Users/fab/GitHub/dgrid/TEST_LOCALE.md

```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Worker starts without errors
- [ ] Task submitted and executed
- [ ] Result captured correctly

   Check: No errors or crashes
   Document: Any issues that come up
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Repository is public on GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Pages dashboard is live and accessible
- [ ] GitHub Actions run successfully

## 📞 Communication Template (When Ready)

```
Subject: 🚀 Join D-GRID: Decentralized Task Execution Network

Hi there!

We've built something special: a fully decentralized system for 
executing tasks across a network of volunteer nodes.

No central server. No single point of failure. Just Git, Docker, 
and Python working in harmony.

We need volunteers like you to be our first nodes.

To join:
1. Install Docker
2. Run: [INSERT DOCKER RUN COMMAND]
3. Watch the dashboard: [INSERT DASHBOARD URL]

That's it. Your node is now part of the network.

Questions? Check the docs: [INSERT GITHUB URL]

Welcome to the future of distributed computing.

The D-GRID Team
